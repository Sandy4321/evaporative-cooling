*ArffConverter/* contains FileConversionGUI.jar, which is a gui for converting data to arff.  We are  working on adding other formats to this utility, but .reformat is a fairly reasonable format to start with.

*Known bug:* If these files are saved in a directory with a very long name, the program may not execute.  Saving them in the C:\ root direcory is safe.
